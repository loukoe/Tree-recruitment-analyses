# Tree-recruitment-analyses

We have made the source code for the statistical analyses in the manuscript "Combining National Forest Inventories Reveals the Distinct Role of Climate on Tree Recruitment in European Forests" publicly available. The code includes model fitting and diagnostics, enabling researchers to adapt the framework to their applications. Since the data preparation is highly country-specific and relies on datasets requiring access permissions, we support reproducibility by providing a small subsample of the processed dataset.
